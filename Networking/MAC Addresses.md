# MAC Addresses
Layer 2 (data-link layer)
MAC = Media Access Control
Also referred to as a *physical address*

MAC addresses are unique and immutable and can therefore be used to identify a specific device - they are tied to the device when it is manufactured as opposed to assigned to it when it connects to a network like a logical (IP) address.

Example: **b0:6e:bf:bc:b6:5c**

MAC addresses have identifiers - the first 3 pairs of hex characters can tell you the manufacturer of a device by using something like https://maclookup.app/

e.g. the above MAC address is for a device built by ASUSTek
