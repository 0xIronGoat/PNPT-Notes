# The OSI Model
7 layers outlining how data is transferred over a network connection.  
Easy to remember with a mnemonic such as: **A**ll **P**eople **S**hould **T**ry **N**ew **D**r **P**epper

## Layer 7 - Application
Provides communications protocols and interfaces for software processes
Top of the stack
Doesn't encapsulate any other protocols
e.g. HTTP, SMTP etc
## Layer 6 - Presentation
Character set conversion
Compression/decompression
Encryption/decryption
e.g. WMV, JPEG, MOV
## Layer 5 - Session
Identify messages belonging to same "conversation"
Dialog control (simplex, half-duplex, duplex)
Establish, manage and terminate session
## Layer 4 - Transport
Multiplexing and de-multiplexing
Reliable (connection-oriented) delivery - TCP
Unreliable (connectionless) delivery - UDP
Devices such as multi-layer switches
Security applications such as advanced firewalls, IDS/IPS etc
## Layer 3 - Network
Moving data around a network of networks
Logical addressing between networks (IP addressing)
Routing
Devices such as routers, layer 3 switches, basic firewalls
## Layer 2 - Data-link
Local network devices
Organise bits in to frames
MAC addresses
Devices such as network interface cards, bridges, basic switches
## Layer 1 - Physical
Nodes, stations, hosts
Signalling
Mechanical specs (cable specs, connector form factors, radio tranceiver specs)
Devices such as tranceivers, media converters, hubs/repeaters, modems
