# Looping
##### For Loops - start to finish of an iterate
```
vegetables = ["carrot", "pepper", "cucumber"]

for x in vegetables:
	print(x) # Print each item in vegetables on a new line
```


##### While Loops - execute as long as a condition is true
```
i = 1

while i < 10:
	print(i) # Print value of i
	i += 1 # Increase value of i by 1
```
