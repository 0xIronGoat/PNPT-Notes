# Viewing, Creating and Editing Files
`echo` - print a statement to the terminal. This can be redirected to a file with `>` to overwrite or `>>` to append to the file  
`cat` - print out file contents to the terminal  
`touch` - create an empty new file  
`vi` or `vim` - command line text editor. Not easy to use for beginners but if you are on a Linux machine you can almost guarantee this will be present, can't say the same for other text editors.  
`nano` - easier command line text editor  

You could also open a file with any GUI text editor you may have installed such as `gedit`.
