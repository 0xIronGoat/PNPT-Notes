### Studying:
Multiple notebooks with different focuses? E.g. one for Active Directory with cheat sheets, enumerations etc.

For a course, write everything out going through it, then go back and create a cheat sheet.

Add pictures.

Notebook can/will evolve over time, you can add/remove things etc.


### Pentest Assessments:
Different headings for External, Internal, Web Apps etc
Sub-notes containing references such as commands issues, screenshots proving results, add detailed notes if necessary.

Use these notes at the end when writing your report.
