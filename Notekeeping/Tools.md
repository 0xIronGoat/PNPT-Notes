### Other Tools
Greenshot - Screenshot tools
Flameshot - Another screenshot tool

**Any reason to use these over the screenshot tool built in to Kali and other Linux distros?**

**Yes!** For Greenshot (and probably very similar for Flameshot), pressing Print Screen brings up a cursor you can drag and select and get a number of options for what to do with the screenshot, has its own image editor which can be accessed from here - very quick, feature-rich and easy to use.
