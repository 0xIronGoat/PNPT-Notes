# Notekeeping Tools

### Notekeeping Applications
KeepNote  
CherryTree  
OneNote  
Joplin  
Obsidian (used for these notes!)  


### Other Tools
Greenshot - Screenshot tool for Windows/Mac  
Flameshot - Screenshot tools for Windows/Mac/Linux

**Any reason to use these over the screenshot tool built in to Kali and other Linux distros?**

**Yes!** Taking a screenshot brings up a cursor you can drag and select and get a number of options for what to do with the screenshot, has its own image editor which can be accessed from here - very quick, feature-rich and easy to use. Lets you resize, move and edit your screenshot as you take it and then you can copy it to a document or save it as a new file.
