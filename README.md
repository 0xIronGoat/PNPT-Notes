# PNPT-Notes
This repo contains my notes taken as I progress through the TCM study material on the path to passing the PNPT exam.

I used Obsidian to take these notes and they consist of basic markdown files structured across various folders.

For the best experience...

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

2. Clone this repo with the below command:

`git clone https://github.com/0xIronGoat/PNPT-Notes.git`  

3. Then open the repo folder as a vault from within Obsidian.
