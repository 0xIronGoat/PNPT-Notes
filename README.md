# PNPT-Notes
This repo contains my notes taken as I progress through the TCM study material on the path to passing the PNPT exam. These notes aren't meant to be exhaustive, and I've left out things like setting up and solving of labs etc, so these are not intended to be a replacement for any of the TCM courses but rather just a supplement.

I intend to use this repo as a one-stop-shop for all my notes going forward, even past the PNPT.

I used Obsidian to take these notes and they consist of basic markdown files structured across various folders.

For the best experience...

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

2. Clone this repo with the below command:

`git clone https://github.com/0xIronGoat/PNPT-Notes.git`  

3. Then open the repo folder as a vault from within Obsidian.

Note: If opened in Obsidian, press `crtl + shift + =` to view a mind map of your current page.
