# Information Gathering with Burp Suite
### Basic Usage
Once Burp is set up and running, navigate to a website in your browser.  
You'll notice it won't load right away, but instead the "Proxy" tab in Burp will be flashing orange with the HTTP request.  
You can forward through all the steps of this request, catch any responses, modify these at each step etc.  
You can see all the URLs that your traffic is going through, view the web structure of your target as your browse it.
