# Hunting Subdomains

Use tools such as [[Tools/Subdomains/Sublist3r|Sublist3r]] or [[Tools/Subdomains/crt.sh|crt.sh]] to find subdomains for your target domain

[[Tools/Subdomains/OWASP Amass|OWASP Amass]] is a very popular tool for subdomain discovery - not covered in the course video as it is time consuming to install and use, however very powerful so try it out.

You can then use tools like [[Tools/Subdomains/HTTProbe|HTTProbe]] to determine if any of your discovered subdomains are active.

**Active vs Passive** - Active is considered anything where you are actively browsing,using/interacting with a website/target. Passive is just using web discovery tools e.g. search engines.
