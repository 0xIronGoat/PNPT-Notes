# Utilising Social Media
LinkedIn  
Twitter  
Facebook  

Search photos for badge pictures, desk pictures, photos of software and tools etc. People continuously post things they shouldn't be that could give you valuable insight in to your target.  

Gather as much info as you can and try to combine it with info gained from previous recon.  

e.g. you can view staff names on LinkedIn, combine with our email recon which gave us some email formats (e.g. firstname.lastname@tesla.com) and combine with info gleaned from social media.
