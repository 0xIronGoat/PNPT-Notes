# Identifying Our Target
Will be using [BugCrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/) for this portion of the course. Make an account on their Researcher Portal and choose a program to get started.

In this case, Heath is going with Tesla.

It is imperative that you pay attention to the *scope* of the program you choose. Make sure you stay within the "In Scope" targets and do not attack anything listed in the "Out Of Scope" section!
