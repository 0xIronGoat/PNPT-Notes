[Find out what websites are built with - Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)

A browser extension that can quickly analyse a website and tell you what technologies it is working with. Not as much info as [[Website Technologies/BuiltWith|BuiltWith]] but quicker and easier to see as it's accessible as you are viewing the website.  

**Note:** This could be considered **active** scanning as you need to visit/interact with the website to get results.
