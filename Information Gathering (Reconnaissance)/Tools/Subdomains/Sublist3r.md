# Sublist3r

Install with package manager (e.g. `apt install sublist3r`)  

Give a domain and it will search various engines for any subdomains
e.g. `sublist3r -d tesla.com`  

If it is slow, use the `-t` option to devote more threads to the process
e.g. `sublister -d tesla.com -t 100` for 100 threads
