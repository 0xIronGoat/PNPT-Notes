**$5.49 per week** for real time asset monitoring, monitoring of multiple assets, unlimited asset searches, 24/7 support.

Might be worth paying for a week just to see it in action for myself.

Lets you search by multiple fields such as email, username, IP address, phone number, VIN etc.

This can let you expand on the information you have, relate multiple accounts to each other, give you leaked passwords, hashes etc.

You could then try to crack a password hash with an online hash cracker (hashes.org appears to no longer exist but you could use [[Online Hash Crackers#hashes com|hashes.com]] or [[Online Hash Crackers#crackstation net|crackstation.net]]).

e.g. we found `shark@tesla.com` from a dump of breached credentials with [[Email & User Recon/Breach-Parse|Breach-Parse]], we then searched for it here and found a number of other accounts and passwords potentially linked to this email
